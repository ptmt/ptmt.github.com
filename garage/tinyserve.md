summary: Hosting for small and unambitious projects
---

The problem: you vibe coded a service that only your family and friends need. What if you have 10 of such projects?

Host it from home. Accept the trade-offs.

Even 16GB of RAM of Mac Mini is enough. AI makes services with less memory footprint, because less features and less dependencies. And in languages like Go or Rust, with the single contained binary.
