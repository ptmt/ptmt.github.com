In JetBrains YouTrack is a issue tracker of choice. 

The number of features there is enourmous. Take automation workflows for example. And the installation has million of issues already.

I wanted something simple, something, that can solve my use cases.

## Inbox

You can do it on email side. But I wanted to check if I can do it here too, because I can also triage it immidietly having all actions right here. 

## Hassle-free issue creation

If you just had an idea for backlog or new incident, or whathever. Creating the issue should cost any cognitive load. 

## Percieved performance

I can't increase server-side speed, but my goal is to make it comfortable to use.
