Here goes the image of a popular meme. I won't use AI for visualizing it.


[self hosted blog] -> [do not care just give me engagement] -> [self hosted blog]

I have had multiple blogs in my life. At some point I created a separate blog on tumblr just for 7 day long trip, and I still love it. Getting back and re-reading it once in 5 years gives me chills. Maybe I'll bring it here when I will come up with the proper solution to separation. Another time, I used throw-away name on the blogspot or Wordpress - just something that costs me nothing and hassle-free. And it still goes working and can be opened after all those years.

20 years ago I loved writing so much, that I did it almost everyday. After some time I decided it doesn't look good and I need more profoessinal blog post. Then I decided I want to write esseys (god, they were bad). They were so bad, that it led me to the invevitable conclusion - not just stop doing that, but shut down the site.

And then 10 years ago, it was clear that social media gives you so much more boost, it felt great, you could easily discover new people, and they can discover you.

Turns out, RSS is great too. Owning your content feels right. 

Hence, I care now more about ability to have more permanent place, that can be referenced from the future.
