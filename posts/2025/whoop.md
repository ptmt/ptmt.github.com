- dopamine, tik tok for HRV

- the promise of wearing it all the time and hope for measuring hr 24x7 and access to so much data
- ios app quality
- fashion attribute: people have common hobbies and attitude. 
- but hardware quality is lacking
- not needed for charging it for weeks is nice feeling, but surprisingly not that important
- what it could measure, no wonder, no suprises
- "feel on the hand" is not my cup of tea, still can't make a piece out of it
- you're sick — no support at all, no "pause" of any sort, gives you one more thing to worry about
- metrics, too few. 
- HRV is a not a holy grail, and even that is undermeasured, a lot of secret sauce that is not tranparent
- Big Brother concern
- closed garden, all data lives inside the app, no other angle, only small dataset export
