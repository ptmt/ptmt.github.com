- the promise of wearing it all the time and hope for measuring hr 24x7 and access to so much data
- ios app quality
- fashion attribute: people have common hobbies and attitude. 
- but hardware quality is lacking
- what it could measure, no wonder
- "feel on the hand" is not my cup of tea, still can't make a piece out of it
- you're sick — no support at all, "pause"
- metrics
- Big Brother concern
- closed garden, all data lives inside the app, no other angle, only small dataset export
