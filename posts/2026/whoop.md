    captionText: After 10 years of Apple Watch, I decided to try something new. Notification fatigue, ecosystem fatigue. *What else is there?* Whoop gained popularity by being fashion statement. Dopamine for health data. But also simplicity. The promise of wearing Whoop all the time, such wide access to data, not missing any single activity, counting everything. What insights I can gain? Will it motivate me be healthier? Will I get inner calmness?

    captionText: First impression dissapoints. Changing bands is simple, but clumsy and low confidence. It feels less premium. For swimming I hate non-rubber bands in water, but rubber is not nice in casual 24x7 life. *I hope I'll get used to it.*

  #   captionText: "Fashion attribute: people have common hobbies and attitude. Whoop has become more than a fitness tracker—it's a statement piece that signals belonging to a community of health-conscious individuals who share similar values and lifestyles."

    captionText: The app is optimized for retention and it shows. It's just feels right, cozy and I didn't have any problems with finding what I want in it.

  - id: Day 14, Charging
    captionText: Not needing to charge it for weeks is a nice feeling, but surprisingly not that important. Unless you travel often. And you supposed to charge it on you, so you won't loose even a heartbeat. But I'm not convinced.

    captionText: My Whoop's finally calibrated. But what it shows me is barely interesting. HRV in the morning I have hardly trust.

  - id: Day 60, Feel
    captionText: In order to heart rate sensor to work it should slightly push your skin. I don't like that, barely tolerate. Despite extended use, it never feels like a natural part of daily life. Too bulky for what it is.

  - id: Day 63, Sickness
    captionText: You're sick — no support at all, no "pause" of any sort, gives you one more thing to worry about. When you're unwell, the device continues tracking and potentially misinterpreting your data, adding stress rather than providing helpful insights or the ability to pause monitoring.

  - id: Day 70, Metrics
    captionText: Metrics, too few. Despite the promise of comprehensive data, the actual metrics provided feel limited and don't offer the depth of insight that would justify continuous wear.

  - id: Day 80, HRV limitations
    captionText: HRV is not a holy grail, and even that is undermeasured, a lot of secret sauce that is not transparent. The core metric that Whoop emphasizes doesn't live up to its promise, and the lack of transparency about how measurements are calculated undermines trust.

    captionText: Big Brother concern. The continuous monitoring and data collection raise privacy concerns, making users question who has access to their health data and how it might be used.

    captionText: Closed garden, all data lives inside the app, no other angle, only small dataset export. Your health data is locked within Whoop's ecosystem, with limited options for exporting or integrating with other tools, reducing the value of the data you're generating.
