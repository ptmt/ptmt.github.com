    captionText: After 10 years of Apple Watch, I decided to try something new. Whoop gained popularity by being fashion statement and dopahime for health data. But also simplicity. The promise of wearing Whoop all the time and hope for measuring heart rate 24/7 and access to so much data of other users. Consistency is that matters, not missing any single activity, counting everything. What insights I can gain? Will it motivate me be healthier? Will I get inner calmness?

    captionText: Changing bands is simple, but clumsy and doesn't get you confidence. It feels less premium. I swim, so I hate non-rubber bands in water, but it's not that nice in casual life.

    captionText: "Fashion attribute: people have common hobbies and attitude. Whoop has become more than a fitness tracker—it's a statement piece that signals belonging to a community of health-conscious individuals who share similar values and lifestyles."

  - id: charging
    captionText: Not needing to charge it for weeks is a nice feeling, but surprisingly not that important. While the long battery life is convenient, it doesn't significantly impact the overall value proposition or user satisfaction.

    captionText: What it could measure, no wonder, no surprises. The metrics provided are predictable and don't reveal unexpected insights about your health or performance, limiting the value of continuous monitoring.

    captionText: In order to heart rate sensor to work it should slightly push your skin. I don't like that, barely can tolerate. Despite extended use, it never feels like a natural part of daily life.

  - id: sick-support
    captionText: You're sick — no support at all, no "pause" of any sort, gives you one more thing to worry about. When you're unwell, the device continues tracking and potentially misinterpreting your data, adding stress rather than providing helpful insights or the ability to pause monitoring.

  - id: Day 70, Metrics
    captionText: Metrics, too few. Despite the promise of comprehensive data, the actual metrics provided feel limited and don't offer the depth of insight that would justify continuous wear.

    captionText: HRV is not a holy grail, and even that is undermeasured, a lot of secret sauce that is not transparent. The core metric that Whoop emphasizes doesn't live up to its promise, and the lack of transparency about how measurements are calculated undermines trust.

    captionText: Big Brother concern. The continuous monitoring and data collection raise privacy concerns, making users question who has access to their health data and how it might be used.

  - id: Day 100, Closed Garden
    captionText: Closed garden, all data lives inside the app, no other angle, only small dataset export. Your health data is locked within Whoop's ecosystem, with limited options for exporting or integrating with other tools, reducing the value of the data you're generating.
