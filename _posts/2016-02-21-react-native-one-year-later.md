_TL;DR Come for the hype, stay for the confidence._

# Stage One: The first date

Initial conditions:

- A legacy app written on top of some WebView hybrid framework, which
  constantly [facing its limitations](http://potomushto.com/2015/03/02/webviews-are-hard.html).
- A completed web app using `"react": "0.12.x"`
- A conference where React Native has been announced.

And you're waiting. Then one day you wake up in the morning, look out the window at gloomy weather outside, open a browser and see the news all over the internet: React Native has been released and the repo already has a thousand stars.

It's finally the moment to do `npm install react-native-cli`.

# Stage Two: Obsession

After the first two weeks there is only pure joy in the blood. Challenge accepted! Challenge to use fast-growing project in a pretty early stage. The documentation is inconsistent, but it doesn't really matter (there is the [awesome UIExplorer](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/ClipboardExample.js#L33)). Best practices don't exist: doesn't matter, some of such could be ported from the web, some could be used from other native frameworks. Not enough plugins: you can write a plugin that you need by yourself. Apple has released new APIs for 3D Touch Quick Actions. Not a problem. You need more complicated maps than you get out-of-the-box? Let's wrap into JS APIs some of the advanced native implementation.

It's inevitable that you soon get your first sensible [pull request](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/1318) which could take a few weeks of the fun process of contributing. An important lesson here is how to be more careful, after all. Objective C may scare people sometimes, but after a month it doesn't look weird anymore, rather looks like a pragmatic language, full of patterns, paradigms, idioms that were formed over the last decade. It's a new, unknown language which could teach you a lot and refresh sweet memories of pure C. And there is Swift waiting for you.

You are full of energy. You want to apply somehow your previous experience from JS world. Why ObjC doesn't have a popular linters like `eslint` and `jscs`, which helps to strictly enforce code style? You even try [some of them](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/1916), with no luck:

```
React/Views/RCTNavItem.m:53:3: ivar assignment outside accessors or init P2

...

React/Modules/RCTUIManager.m:525:7: long variable name P3 Variable name with 21 characters is longer than the threshold of 20

...

React/Modules/RCTUIManager.m:1114:1: deep nested block P3 Block depth of 6 exceeds limit of 5

P1=0[0] P2=339[10] P3=545[20]
```

_a hundred of warnings_

The community is expanding so fast, that in the next few months it will [outgrow](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) its Slack server. The only way to keep up with that huge amount of information is Brent Vatne, who sends the [newsletter](http://brentvatne.ca/react-native-newsletter/) each week and one day you even become [part of it](http://reactnative.cc/14-07-2015.html).

# Stage Three: Routine

So, you're married now, [the honeymoon at Paris](http://potomushto.com/2015/07/30/react-europe.html) has ended a weeks ago. Welcome to everyday life.

At first, you realize, that React doesn't solve all problems with performance magically. Regarding you can't affect UI thread directly, and React gives you _cheap_ updates, there are tons of potential bottlenecks. Blocking Javascript Thread is one of these.

So you profile, enforce pure components, cache reducers, do whatever generic strategy for optimizing the React performance and always have an option: writing a low-level Objective C.

_Wow, such memory leaks from an almost empty project! Brave GC on JavascriptCore struggling with the
inexperienced developer._

It's nice that all XCode's instruments Chrome Developer Tools finally available for you.
And by the way, nothing serious here, just an issue with the environment's settings.

Your everyday routine is a forking almost every second `react-native-%plugin%` out there.
Your everyday routine is a writing your own `RCT_EXPORT_MODULE`.
Your everyday routine is upgrading some npm module on the next version.

But in the end it's getting better and better every day:

- [RNPlay](https://rnplay.org) allows to check your ideas instantly;
- [RNPM](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) is becoming a thing;
- State management solved for you: use either GraphQL/Relay ([Reindex](https://reindex.io)) or Redux + AsyncStorage. Ok, not quite solved, but it's also just another routine.
- [Ship your app 10 times](https://apphub.io) per day.
- React gives you familiar abstractions which feels more right than .xib, UIViewController, AutoLayout, CoreData. And it's **up to you** how much of your app would be on the native side.

# Stage Four: Inspiration

It's February 2016. You are working on your sixth iOS app, hoping it would be better than previous ones: like [hash.ai](https://hash.ai), [wizearn](http://wizearn.com/) or [flawless](http://hiflawless.com). After all, you're getting inspired for some other projects like [https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos) and SkeletCode.

You get used to react-native related issues. It's not a commercial software, and **minor bugs** are not felt as something unexpected, whereas all conceptual things such as [assets management](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html#content) or Navigator develops in the transparent and clear way. (**Update from 2017** Boy I was wrong about Navigation).

As for weird and overbloated JS ecosystem these very lines are written in Jekyll 3, and that ruby gem doesn't work great. Some combination of versions of an operating system, Ruby and Jekyll produce a bug affecting new post rendering (`future: true`). An hour on reading GitHub issues, reinstalling Jekyll, and other voodoo tricks ("Ruby can't into timestamps").

So the openness of tooling you're using is the key. I'd rather dig out into Jekyll source code to find and fix that problem by myself. Can I do that in a reasonable amount of time? I certainly can with React Native now, and that makes me confident.

_INB4; (201x) Stage Five â€” Oh, see, the trend has changed, there is another cool technology, let's go there!_
