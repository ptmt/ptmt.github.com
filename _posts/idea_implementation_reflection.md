Or to put it differently: *Thoughts, Executions, Experiences*. Or *Concepts, Projects, Blogs*. Or *Questions, Experiments, Results*.

I want to collect ideas. Not because they're good. The ideas means nothing. Execution is what matters.
But a plain idea can lead to another, this might be eventually useful.
When you find out later that somebody else executed the idea perfectly, you already know what's this about.

An idea that receive an attention and became a proper experiment means it's an idea that important enough, new enough, interesting enough.
Published apps, shipped web-sites, written code â€” all this sounds so satisfactory, doesn't it?

In the end, given how small my ideas are, projects matter not much too.

Which leads to the most important thing. *Experience*. The path, that I reflected upon and converted into shareable format.
