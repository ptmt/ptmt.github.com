I will remember July 2015 as a local extremum of the hype about React.js.
It's kind of symbolic because at the time Paris has a maximum temperature in years (second time in the recorded history).  
React is exploding fast. I've been writing javascript views as a f(data) for a few months and it feels great.

"_It states that any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript_".

Everything that could be combined with word `React` eventually will be. Add `webpack`, `native`, `redux`, `router`, `example`, `universal` and try to combine by yourself.
