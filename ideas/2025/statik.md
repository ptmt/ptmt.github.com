A set of scripts that can transform set of markdown into a web-site.

Reasons, randomly:

- __Procrastinatination__. *Just one more feature, bro. Just one more feature* Instead of writing posts, you build your web-site.
- __No end goal__. To me, it's not a product I should ship. Don't care about value. Maybe should, but I don't. It's my garage, where I invite my friends sometimes. 

### Why don't PHP? Why GitHub Pages?

I have an intention to make it fully dynamic, but also don't want to host it in cloud. I don't remember why, but 10 years ago I didn't like storing web-site in git
