My name is Dmitrii Loktev (In German: Dmitrij). 

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet, as they used to say in 90s. It's a blog, a public journal, and a collection of projects.

I work as a software engineer in my daily job at JetBrains.

In 2010s I was busy in my everyday job with mobile apps and full stack tasks around them, when needed, in order to make it work. Nowadays, LLM are transforming our lifes and am trying to find if there's more than just dophamine, anxiety and frustration.
