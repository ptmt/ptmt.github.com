- The layout is very minimalistic, typography friendly.
- Main page is a number of sections: latest posts, ideas board, random quote and a random picture. For that, all pictures on the web-site should be indexed and be available as json. `/datasource/images.json` (Need to think where to store images)
- Another thing on main is a random quote. For that all quotes should be indexed and stored somewhere as json - it's in `/datasource/quote.json`. And javascript code should load and show the quote randomly. 
- Garage has lifecycle (Idea -> Project -> Archived), main page has all three columns
- Posts is just a feed by default, but encoded with color or some other attributes. Posts in German or Russian can be filtered out. 
- Each year of post has a special newspaper layout that summarizes the year
- __Garage__ should be a separate page with possibly real photo where I have both wall (or bookshelf), and desk and whiteboard (ideas)
